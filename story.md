The Last Commit

Jason, a software developer, was deep into coding a new feature for his app when disaster struck. 
His computer froze, the cursor refusing to budge no matter how many keys he pressed. 
His heart raced as he realized he hadn’t saved his work in hours.
"Not now," he muttered, staring at the frozen screen, his mind scrambling for a solution. 
He had been adding complex functionality to the app and hadn’t committed his changes in so long. 
He knew he was in trouble.

After what felt like an eternity, Jason managed to reboot the system. The screen blinked back to life, 
and he quickly opened his terminal. But as he stared at the prompt, a sinking feeling spread through him. 
The terminal showed a message that confirmed his worst fear: Uncommitted changes. 
The progress he had made today, potentially lost.

Then, like a lamp turning on, Jason remembered—Git had a history. A backup of his work, something he could rely on.
He quickly started searching through the commit logs, hoping there was something recent enough to restore. 
His hands shook as he scrolled through the history, until he finally found it—the last stable commit 
before he’d made the risky edits.

A wave of relief washed over him as he saw his work preserved. With a few quick commands, 
Jason restored his project to its last saved state. It wasn’t the latest version, but it was something. It was progress.

He let out a long breath, grateful that Git had saved him once again. He quickly made a new commit, 
this time including a message to remind himself of the close call.
"Git to the rescue," Jason smiled to himself, feeling a renewed sense of determination as he got back to work.
